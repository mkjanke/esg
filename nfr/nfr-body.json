  "Requirements": [
    {
      "Index": "RESILIENCY-HARDWARE",
      "Category": "Resiliency",
      "Context": "Hardware",
      "Goals": "Goals: When hardware component fails, the repair or replacement of the failed hardware must be treatable as routine system maintenance rather than as a service affecting outage or emergency.",
      "Rationale": "Rationale: If the availability of the system is sufficiently critical, the MTTR must not be dependent on the response time of hardware vendors, the availability of repair parts or the availability of staff. The availability of the system therefore must be decoupled from the availability of any single hardware component or any individual staff person.",
      "Requirement": "Requirement: Failure of a single hardware component shall not cause user detectable loss of business functionality for an elapsed time more than Metric. After an elapsed time no longer than Metric, the user will be able to continue business functionality.",
      "Scale": "Scale: Seconds duration, business day, elapsed time ",
      "Status": "Approved, Requirement"
