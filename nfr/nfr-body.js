      "Context": "Hardware",
      "Goals": "Goals: When hardware component fails, the repair or replacement of the failed hardware must be treatable as routine system maintenance rather than as a service affecting outage or emergency.",
      "Rationale": "Rationale: If the availability of the system is sufficiently critical, the MTTR must not be dependent on the response time of hardware vendors, the availability of repair parts or the availability of staff. The availability of the system therefore must be decoupled from the availability of any single hardware component or any individual staff person.",

      "Rationale": "Rationale: If the availability of the system is sufficiently critical, the MTTR must not be dependent on the response time of staff, manual recovery processes, or the clock time required diagnosing the failure. The availability of the system therefore must be decoupled from the availability of any single software component or any individual staff person.",

      "Rationale": "Rationale: If the availability of the system is sufficiently critical, the MTTR should not be dependent on the response time of vendors, the availability of repair parts or the availability of staff. The availability of the system therefore must be decoupled from the availability of any single environmental component.",

The recovered system configuration must be identical to the pre-failed state.",

Systems must be designed such that routine maintenance of system components may be performed during business hours with no user detectable loss of business functionality. The number of maintenance operations that require outages should be minimized.",
      "Rationale": "Rationale: If the availability of the system is sufficiently critical, the user expectation for maintenance related outages will be such that systems of moderate complexity can no longer be scheduled with off line maintenance windows of acceptable frequency and duration. To meet availability goals, most system maintenance will need to be performed while users are accessing the system.",
      "Requirement": "Requirement: Routine system patching, system configuration, maintenance of individual system and environmental components shall not cause user detectable loss of business functionality for an amount of time greater than Metric. After an elapsed time no longer than Metric, the user will be able to continue business functionality.

No more than an acceptable data loss should result from the unplanned configuration. The recovered system must be capable of meeting all pre-modification functional and non-functional requirements. Sufficient logging and auditing must be in place to determine the source of the modification. The response to unauthorized modification must follow a pre-determined process or plan.",

The ability to access and modify the data must be limited to authorized individuals. The authorization must be dependent on current work assignment, job function or other business requirement.",
      "Rationale": "Rationale: Limiting an individual’s access to only the systems and data they need to complete work assignments or job duties mitigates inappropriate access or modification of protected or confidential data.",
      "Requirement": "Requirement: Access to data must be granted to individuals by the data owner or person authorized to grant access. Access must be revoked when it is no longer required for the individual’s work assignment or job duties. Logging of access must be implemented to Metric.
